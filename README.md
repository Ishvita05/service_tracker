I developed a service request tracking system to streamline internal issue management. 
The system, built with Python and SQLite, allows users and admins to log, update, and track tickets. 
I implemented classification logic for issue prioritization and automated escalation workflows. 
To provide visibility, I designed Power BI dashboards to analyze request volumes, categories, and resolution times. 
The project demonstrates end-to-end data pipeline design, database management, and visualization for operational analytics.
